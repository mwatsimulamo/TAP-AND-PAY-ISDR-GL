As a beginner in Haskell, I developed a small program to facilitate the recording of academic fee payments in ADA (cryptocurrency) at ISDR-GL, our institution.
Features:
The program works in a simple and interactive manner:
Student Name Input: Upon execution, the program prompts the user to enter the student's name.
ADA Amount Input: Once the name is entered, the program requests the amount of academic fees to be paid in ADA.
Confirmation and Transaction ID: After entering the amount, the program displays a payment confirmation message, accompanied by a unique transaction ID.
