#Introduction
=
This small system was developed as part of a Marathon organized by Coxygen, within the framework of the Haskell Plutus learning program, a project funded by Project Catalyst.
The goal was to design a simple Haskell-based application to simulate the recording of academic fee payments in ADA (cryptocurrency) for students at our institution, ISDR-GL.

#ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To offer a lightweight, interactive tool that allows:
- Identifying students making payments.
- Recording amounts paid in ADA.
- Generating unique transaction identifiers for traceability.
  
#ðŸ”§ Features

- Student Name Input
Upon execution, the system prompts the user to enter the student's name.

- ADA Amount Input
After the name is entered, the user is asked to enter the amount to be paid in ADA.

- Payment Confirmation
The program confirms the transaction and displays a unique transaction ID, generated based on the student name and the amount.

ðŸ’¡ Notes
This project is intended as a learning exercise for beginners in Haskell and Plutus.
It can be executed directly in Replit (https://replit.com) for easy testing and demonstration.

While it's a simulation, it reflects basic concepts of user interaction, error handling, and transaction logic.

#ðŸ“Œ Conclusion

This code demonstrates how even a beginner-level Haskell program can be applied to real-world-like scenarios such as tuition payment tracking using cryptocurrency. It reflects the power of functional programming in building secure, reliable, and interactive financial tools.
